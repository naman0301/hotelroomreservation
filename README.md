# The purpose of this project is to implement the front and backend of a system. 
# The front end of the website is written in HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and Media queries which takes the userâ€™s input and once submitted saves that data on the backend side using PHP and MySQL database 
# With such system the owner of the hotel can keep digital records of the number of rooms booked for a particular day as well as avoid any duplicate/invalid entry during the reservation time
# By combining this data with PowerBI, owners can predict average number of rooms booked during the peak and off-peak seasons and in turn plan their budget accordingly

# Word of Mouth from the developer:

# After shifting the hosting platform I observed that while opening the website, it is showing deceptive site ahead but no need to worry about it. This project is only for showing my skills in full stack development, you may enter any dummy data into the form details. Its purpose is only to show other developers or recruitors that the data they are entering into the fields is getting store into the database on the backend side. I assure everyone who tries this website with full authentication and no stealing of data instead I would be deleting any other data then the top 3 default ones within 3-4 hours of the time you inserted. The top 3 dummy data would always be there in the table since that I wrote myself into the table. Please don't hesitate to go through the website. It's fully legitimate and I have my words for it. 

# To view the website please click on DETAILS button and after that click on VISIT THIS SITE text to view the project. I as the creator of this project assure you that no entered data would be used for unethical reasons and would be deleted from the database within the promised time.
