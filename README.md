# The purpose of this project is to implement the front and backend of a system. 
# The front end of the website is written in HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and Media queries which takes the userâ€™s input and once submitted saves that data on the backend side using PHP and MySQL database 
# With such system the owner of the hotel can keep digital records of the number of rooms booked for a particular day as well as avoid any duplicate/invalid entry during the reservation time
# By combining this data with PowerBI, owners can predict average number of rooms booked during the peak and off-peak seasons and in turn plan their budget accordingly
